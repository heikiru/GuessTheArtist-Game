# GuessTheArtist-Game
The game has the objective of testing the knowledge of the user, just like a quiz.

We are working on 3 branches for now.
  "Midway" will be used to test and upload new classes for the project.
  "LastChapter" will be used to receive the classes that are in perfect conditions after their respective tests.
  After all, everything will be thrown in the Master branch and the project finally closed. 
  
  Still need to do:
    * Class diagram using Draw.io, based on UML files;
    * Define a project pattern;
    * Build the GUI;
    * Create the .jar;
    * Needs to add the .gitignore file!
